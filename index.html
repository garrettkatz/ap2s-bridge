<h1>AP2S: Automated Program and Proof Synthesis</h1>

<div>Part of the <a href="https://aaai.org/aaai-conference/bridge-program-call-for-proposals/">AAAI-24 Bridge Program</a></div>
<br>

Automated Program and Proof Synthesis (AP2S) are two long-standing, closely-related challenges in AI, recently advanced through the incorporation of deep learning.  However, much research focuses exclusively on one or the other, instead of leveraging synergies between them.  This bridge workshop, a continuation of last year's <a href="ap2s2023.html">2023 inaugural meeting</a>, aims to connect researchers from each sub-field and educate them about the other, including but not limited to recent applications of deep learning.  The workshop will involve a series of tutorial lectures followed by group discussion.<br>

<h2 id="cfp" class="navhead">Call for Participation</h2>

Automated Program and Proof Synthesis (AP2S) are two long-standing, closely-related challenges in AI, recently advanced through the incorporation of deep learning.  However, much research focuses exclusively on one or the other, instead of leveraging synergies between them.  This bridge program aims to connect researchers from each sub-field and educate them about the other, including but not limited to recent deep-learning techniques.  Contributions are welcome in the form of educational lectures and tutorials.<br>
<br>

<h3>Program Scope</h3>

The focus of the bridge is on underlying principles common to both program and proof synthesis.  Both problems involve document generation in strict formal languages, leveraging large structured prior "knowledge" (known theorems or existing software libraries), navigating vast search spaces (possible proofs and programs), and high-level cognitive abilities (creativity and abstraction).  Both problems have witnessed recent advances with deep learning, making this program especially timely.  Each problem can also be framed as an instance of the other.

Grand challenges envisioned for this bridge include:
<ul>
<li>Automatically synthesized constructive existence proofs for novel algorithms with improved complexity characteristics</li>
<li>Deciding as-yet unsolved conjectures by automatically synthesizing programs in the languages of interactive proof systems</li>
<li>"Executing" a partially developed proof on concrete examples as "input", similarly to running a program, to guide the automated proof synthesis process</li>
<li>State-of-the-art in both program and proof synthesis using a common core deep learning technique</li>
<li>Fast, automated program and proof repair when a dependency (software library or axiomatization) is changed</li>
</ul>

Topics for educational lectures/tutorials include:
<ul>
<li>Automated theorem proving techniques (e.g. resolution, paramodulation, term rewriting, etc.)</li>
<li>Automated program synthesis methods (e.g. abstraction domains, genetic programming)</li>
<li>Interactive proof systems (e.g. Metamath, Lean, Coq, Isabelle/HOL, etc.)</li>
<li>Automated proof systems (e.g. Vampire, E, etc.)</li>
<li>Deep learning techniques relevant to AP2S (e.g. transformers, graph neural networks, etc.)</li>
<li>Recent datasets relevant to AP2S (e.g. HOLStep, ProgRES, etc.)
<li>Human reasoning processes during human program and/or proof synthesis</li>
</ul>

<h3>Program Structure</h3>

The bridge will be a one-day program with the following format:
<ul>
<li>Quarter-day session with lectures/tutorials related to automated program synthesis</li>
<li>Quarter-day session with lectures/tutorials related to interactive proof systems</li>
<li>Quarter-day session with lectures/tutorials related to automated theorem proving</li>
<li>Quarter-day session for group discussion
</ul>
Each session will be separated by a coffee or lunch break.

<h3>Target audience and attendance</h3>

The bridge aims to include 6-9 educational lectures/tutorials and 20-40 attendees.  Space permitting, all are welcome to attend, with priority given to speakers, their collaborators, and students.

<h3>Submission Requirements</h3>

Proposals for educational lecture/tutorials should include draft presentation slides in PDF format, CVs of the speaker(s) in 2-page NSF Biosketch Format, and a brief cover page.  The cover page must include a paragraph summary of the talk, a proposed duration (either 30, 45, or 90 minutes), and the names, affiliations, and contact information for the speaker(s).<br>
<br>
Submissions should be made on Microsoft CMT <a href="https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/AP2S2024/Submission/Index">here</a>.

<h3>Important dates:</h3>
<ul>
<li>November 24, 2023: Deadline for submissions</li>
<li>Friday, December 11, 2023: Submission decision notifications posted</li>
<li>Monday, December 20, 2023: Early registration deadline</li>

<!-- The AP2S bridge program welcomes contributions in the form of tutorials and extended abstracts.  Tutorials will be grouped into three quarter-day tutorial sessions, and extended abstracts will be presented via a poster session and lightning talks in the last quarter at the end of the  -->

<!-- Long-form lectures and tutorials will serve to educate attendees on fundamental theory, methodology, toolchains, and practical considerations underlying program and proof synthesis.  Extended abstracts may focus on current research, new benchmarks, and opinions, and will be considered for poster presentations and short 5-minute lightning talks in the latter part of the program.  The program will end with a group panel discussion and networking session to stimulate new ideas and identify potential collaborations. -->
