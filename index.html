<h1 style="text-align:center">AP2S: Automated Program and Proof Synthesis AAAI-23 Bridge Program</h1>

Automated Program and Proof Synthesis (AP2S) are two long-standing, closely-related challenges in AI, recently advanced through the incorporation of deep learning.  However, much research focuses exclusively on one or the other, instead of leveraging synergies between them.  This bridge program aims to connect researchers from each sub-field and educate them about the other, including but not limited to recent deep learning techniques.

<h2 style="text-align:center">Call for Contributions</h2>

<h3>Program Structure</h3>

The AP2S bridge program welcomes contributions in the form of lectures, tutorials, and extended abstracts.  Long-form lectures and tutorials will serve to educate attendees on fundamental theory, methodology, toolchains, and practical considerations underlying program and proof synthesis.  Extended abstracts may focus on current research, new benchmarks, and opinions, and will be considered for poster presentations and short 5-minute lightning talks in the latter part of the program.  The program will end with a group panel discussion and networking session to stimulate new ideas and identify potential collaborations.

<h3>Program Scope</h3>

The focus of the bridge is on underlying principles common to both program and proof synthesis.  Both problems involve document generation in strict formal languages, leveraging large structured prior "knowledge" (known theorems or existing software libraries), navigating vast search spaces (possible proofs and programs), and high-level cognitive abilities (creativity and abstraction).  Both problems have witnessed recent advances with deep learning, making this program especially timely.  Each problem can also be framed as an instance of the other.

Grand challenges envisioned for this bridge include:
<ul>
<li>Automatically synthesized constructive existence proofs for novel algorithms with improved complexity characteristics</li>
<li>Deciding as-yet unsolved conjectures by automatically synthesizing programs in the languages of interactive proof systems</li>
<li>"Executing" a partially developed proof on concrete examples as "input", similarly to running a program, to guide the automated proof synthesis process</li>
<li>State-of-the-art in both program and proof synthesis using a common core deep learning technique</li>
<li>Fast, automated program and proof repair when a dependency (software library or axiomatization) is changed</li>
</ul>

Topics for contributions include:
<ul>
<li>Lectures on well-established automated theorem proving techniques (e.g. resolution, paramodulation, term rewriting, etc.)</li>
<li>Lectures on well-established automated program synthesis techniques (e.g. abstraction domains, genetic programming, etc.)</li>
<li>Lectures on deep learning techniques relevant to AP2S (e.g. transformers, graph neural networks, etc.)</li>
<li>Lectures on human reasoning processed engaged during human program and/or proof synthesis</li>
<li>Tutorials on interactive proof systems (e.g. Metamath, Lean, Coq, Isabelle/HOL, etc.)</li>
<li>Tutorials on automated proof systems (e.g. Vampire, E, etc.)</li>
<li> Tutorials on automated program synthesis systems (e.g. TBA)</li>
<li> Tutorials on recent datasets relevant to A2PS (e.g. HOLStep, ProgRES, etc.)
<li> Extended abstracts on new research in human and/or automated program and/or proof synthesis, with or without deep learning</li>
<li> Extended abstracts proposing or presenting new datasets or benchmarks for A2PS</li>
<li> Extended abstracts arguing for new directions or practices important to advance A2PS going forward</li>
</ul>

<h3>Submission Format</h3>

Submissions can be made via EasyChair [link TBA]().  Extended abstracts are limited to 4 pages excluding references.  Lecture and tutorial proposals are limited to 2 pages excluding CVs of the speakers; the latter should be included as supplementary material in 2-page NSF Biosketch format.
